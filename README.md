# Covid-19 Data Exploration Project
This is my first SQL and Power BI Project

#### üí° Inspiration 
- While searching for ideas for portfolio projects I found Alex Freberg's [Data Analyst Portfolio Porject Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM), which I decided to follow whilst making it my own. 

---

#### ‚úçüèº The Objective
- Exploring Covid-19 worldwide data.

#### üìà The Dataset 
- Complete Covid-19 dataset (28th January 2020 to 13th November 2021) from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). 

#### üíª Tools Used
- Data Exploration = Microsoft SQL Server
- Dashboard = Microsoft Power BI

# SQL Data Exploration

## Downloading, Modifying and Importing Data
- After downloading the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) we use Excel to split it into 2 xlxs files:
  - One containing all the covid cases and death data:
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94410139/142781218-41229a5e-7200-41f8-b0a6-e7edcc8f183c.png)

  - The other containing vaccination data:

- Once that is done we import both files into Microsoft SQL Server. 

## SQL Server Queries

  ```sql
  -- View Imported Data
  
  SELECT *
  FROM Portfolio_Project..covid_deaths_update
  ```
